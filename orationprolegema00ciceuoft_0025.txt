ness to investigate every complaint, and the graciousness of his
manner, make obedienee delightful, while his elcmency is pro-
verbial.

ἐξ 43-46. As to the prestige of his name, you yourselves showed
what confidence you placed in him last year. The very day he
was appointed to the Ciliciam war the corn-market fell, and
even his mere presence in Asia has arrested the growth of the
allied kings' power.

ἐξ 47-48. As to the fourth point, it is best for mortals, in speaking
of good genius, to speak reservedly and hunibly. Yet 1 will say
that, if the past is any guide to the. future, there is no man on
whom the divine blessing rests so clearly as on Pompey.

(β) ἓ 51. It- remains for me to answer the objections raised against us
gy Hortensius and Catulus, men deservcdly respected hy you as
y me.

§g 52-58. Now Hortensius contends that our principle is bad.
If anyone should be entrusted with such trcmendous respon-
sibility, he admits Pompey is the man, but ho denies our pre-
misses. But 1 maintain that you have already decidcd for us,
and against him. The Gabinian law settled this controversy.
And further, 1 say the Gabinian law has been amply justified
by results. I entreat Hortensius, therefore, to lay aside his
gloomy forebodings, and to hope nothing but good from this
bist—And by—the-byc, I think it would be more graceful if he
would ccase his opposition to the appointment which Gabinius
sceks as Pompey's lieutenant.

59-63. Catulus contends that our proceedings are unconsti-
tutional. He says the risk of staking everything on one man is
too great. Well, 1 admit that perhaps our proposal is a liule
unconstitutional. But I say this, that, some of the greatest
glories of the Roman arins have been a trifle unconstitutional.
1 am afraid Scipio the younger was a sadly unconstitutional
follow-3 but he sacked Carthago and Numantia.

§g 63-68. Speaking then to both Hortensius and Catulus, I ask
them to withdraw an opposition in such palpable antagonism
to your feelings. You showed yourselves truer prophets than
they were on the last occasion. Ι would point them to Pom-
pey's singular fitness for a war in Asia, where none but the
sternest natures can resist the numerous temptations to abuse
their power. They know what the conduct of our officers has
been in Asia, so that our very name stinks thero. They know
what. scandal our praetors have occasioned. And finally, much
as they dcserve your consideration and respect, Ι would ask

⁶ them to pay some. deference to the opinions of such men as
Servilius, Curio, Lentulus, and Cassius, who are ou our side,
and to yield this point with av good grace.
