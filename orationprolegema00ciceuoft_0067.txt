NOTESg 55

ἓ 37.— Ullo in numero. Cicero means ‘ what· commandcr can we think
descrving even of the name of a comnmuder nt all? Aliquo
in> nummo would have meant ‘worthy of any position among
commnmlcrs.’

Cujus ιἰι coecrce‘tzc oemunt, de, ‘in whose army serjenntcies are
being sold, and have been s‹›l<l' for many a day. Ventum,
from veneo ·’ to be sold? Itis uncertain to whom Cicero alludes,
unless it be to Glabrio.

Hunc hominem coyitare: this case of the accusative with the in-
finitive depends on possumus putare in the preceding clause.
Provineioedepends in the genitive on cupiditatem: ‘their adhercnce
to their province.’ Cicero says that these men employed their
allowance from the treasury to bribe the magistrates, ile.
consuls. tribunes, and so on. to continue them in their officc;

in questu, ‘ for im'cstniciit‚' zze. with his bankch.

Feraut=afflra>1t.

,ἓ 38.- Utrum plures—deletas? ‘ Whether do you think that. for the few
past years the enemies' cities destroyed by your soldiers'arms‚
or the settlements of your subjects disorganised by their win-
ter quarte1·s,are the more numerous?’ Cicero seems to con-
trast the mere walls that the enemy had lost with the whole
social life which the subjects had had disturbed.

Qui se ipsum ozon continet, ‘who does not restrnin himself! A
manifest hit at Lucullus, whose sels-indulgent life on service
excited the natural discontent of his men. Severus, ‘ rigid.‘

ἓ 39.-Non modo manus. The ordinary explanation of non modo iu this
construction is to say that another ozon is omitted. And it, is
true that by this expedient we get an equit-alent in sense to the
Latin. Modo is a word of lin1itat1011,and its force here is to
isolate the clause iu which it stands, so that it becomes paren-
thetical. ‘ So that in that vast army, quite apart from a hand,
not even a foot is said to have done violence ;’ 01· ιΙ do not say
a hand.’

Non ‘modo—permittitur. ‘Not only is pressure put upon no ouo
that he should incur outlay on the soldiery, but not even is it
allowed to any one who wishes.' Militem here used not of au
individual soldier, but by metonymy of the army.

Hiemis is the objective genitive aster pensu-qiam, ‘a refuge against
the winter.¹ Avaritiae is the ordinary subjective genitive, ‘a
refuge for cupidity!

ἓ *lu-*Enim here, ns several times before in this oration, does not
menn ‘for ;’ ‘indeed‚y or ‘for certain,’ renders it much more
nearly. Vis'remiyum: it might seem natural to take vis here
in the sense which it bears in ‘odora canum vis, Virg. AEn.
i. 132 of a ‘ body '; perhaps, however, it is best to understand
it of the bodily strength of the rowers. ‘ It was, for certain, no
special vigour of his crcw, no unhenrd-of skill at the helm,
no new winus, which wafted him so swiftly to the ends of the
earth ; it was rather this, that those things· which can usually
eutice others did not deluy him?
