tra while he was eompleting his qualifications to speak there
had been a good thing for the Romans and for himself, for he
had left room for better men in the Rostra, and had made
valuable connections for himself.

Casto integre. These words, coupled with vestro judicio. are meant
to imply that Cicero had not fallen in with the objectionable
practice of taking money from his clientis. So long ago as
204 1³.c. the Lex Cincin had been passed to stop this practice.

Amplissimnm .· ‘ most noble,’ as amplissimus in ἓ 1.

Propter dilationem comitiorum: ‘through an interruptim: ts> the
eleemon) We know nothing of the two occasions on which
these coniitia were inter-rupted. A very slight pretext, how-
ever, served to interrupt them, when it afforded an opportunity
for a party manoeurre. Cicero says that on all three ooea·
sions enough votes had been given him to place him at the
head of the poll.

Honoribus mandandis: ‘ by committing official posts 10 11193,
Honores does not mean ‘eomplimentsz' it has «hc technical
meaning of ‘ the highest offiees in the State!

Qui οἱ qzcoque—duoeeruvt. ⁸ Who have thought that to that
power also a return should be awarded by their estimato! Ei ν
νεῖ refers to the readiness and skill aequired at the bar. ⁴

ἓ 3.——Atque illud .· ‘and besides? Illud is constantly used to introduco
an additional idea. In the last seetion Cicero has said that 119
will speak if it is only to show his gratitudo 10 1119 Romans.
Resides, 119 adds here, ‘ I could not have a better opportunity!

Ratione dicendi, The ‘ praetiee' in the senso in which we speak
of the ‘ practice of the courtz‘ ‘proeedurel ‘While the prac-
tice of speakers from this place is unfamiliar to me:

Oratio: ‘ language ε ’ ‘ the material for a speech.’

g 4.—Causa. This is 0119 of ‘those words which young readers should
always beware of translating by a Latinized English word
such as ‘ cause.’ It means here 1119 ‘state or condition of
affairs! ‘Whenee all this state of the ease starts!

Vectigalibus is probably the dative of vectigalia, not τεαὶ-φῶτε.
The reveuue and tho people from whom the reveuue is dnm-n
are coupled similarly in g 45, socios ct vectiyalia.

Alter relictus—alter lacessitus. ¹ The former let slip, 1119 latter
challenged! Cicero uses his language cleverly to create a
prejudieo against Lucullus at tho very outset. By relictus 119
insinuates that L. was answerablc for the escape of Mithridates
aster his complete defeat before Cabeira (11.9. 72). The King
in fact only oseaped through 1119 cupidity of his pursuers, who
stopped to plunder a 1111119 laden with gold. But as Lucullus
could hardly help this, Cicero probably insinuatos thatif L. had
not stayed 10 make himself master of Cabeira, he might have
overtaken M.bef0re he reached Armenia. By ‘lacessitus' Cicero
recalls 1119 insolent conduct of Appius Claudius to Tigranes,
when 119 went from Lucullus to demand the sui-render of
Mithridates. Iu ξ 23 Cicero says it had never been 1119 poliey
of Rome to make 911 enemy of Armenia.
