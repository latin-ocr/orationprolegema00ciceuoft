against them.

The occasion of the speech was less memorable than
the speech itself. The position of the Roman forces in
Asia was, no doubt, grave3 but the real crisis was in
Cicero’s own fortunes. And, without taking the same
harsh view of Cicero's vain and feeble character as
Mommsen, we can see in the spirited partisanship, the

some transient gleams of sunshine had brightened the
fortunes of Mithridates3 but they were wholly due to
the Roman mismanagement, and were illusory. Thus, the
uncourteous and objectless infraction of etiquette com·
