Tun OBJECT of examinations like the Oxford and
Cambridge Local Examinations being, to a large extent,
very special, special editions of the subjects presented
by the candidates seem needed. Where mental dis-
cipline is the chief end proposed, the study of an
author assumes an intensity which to a young student
may be positively injurious. He is expected to know
an amount of collater-al information which, to a boy
under fifteen, seems unattainable erudition3 and the
more zealous the boy, the greater perplexity he is
involved in, because the more historical allusions he
attempts to grapple with, the more do his problems
grow. The Third Mithridatio NVar lands him in the
Second and the First, while the slightest allusion to
the Marians springs the whole mine of the Civil VVar
upon him. After a while he despairs of finding a path ,
through the labyrinth of Biographical, Geographical,
and A'rchaeological dictionaries, and becomes muddled.
