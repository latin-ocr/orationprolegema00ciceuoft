the town the Sinopians obtained very favourable terms,
while the Pontians were put to the sword. The Romans
restored to Sinope its independence. Sinope was famous as
the birth-place of Diogenes.

Ducibus Sertorianis. One of these was M. Varius or Marius, a
Roman Senator in exile, sent by Sertorius to Mithridates to
take a command under him, Rc. 75. Varius was placed in
command of M.·'s fleet ΒΑ). 73, and was utterly defeated by
Lucullus off Lemnos, and himself taken prisoner. Studio,
‘ party passion ‘; raperetur, ‘ was tearing along? ”

Salvis· populi Romani εοοὶἱε, ‘ without taxing the subjects of the
Roman people. and without impoverishing the treasury!
Lucullus paid the whole eost of the Armenian war out of the
boot .

Salis offiium—laudatum. ⁴ 1 think, burgesses, that this is hand-
some praise ; nay, to tell you my opinion, that Lucius Lucullus
has been praised from this place equally by none of my friends
who oppose this bill and this movement! This is merely a
piece of good-humoured banter at the expense of Hortensius
and Catulus, Cicero says in effect, ⁴1 run down Lucullus?
thy. I make him out better thnn his own supportersff It is
n trick as familiar to modern as to ancient lawyers. ‘Iste‘ is
a technical word for an adversary, as οὗτος generally is in
Greek orations.

§fisumque-etur, ῥ’·ο. Having praised Lucullus up to the skies,
Cicero goes on to show that on the present occasion his merits
ought not to count.

. Dispersa, ‘ stragghng? There is no question of hypallage here,
οι· question of dispersa being added as an afterthought. If
Medea had cut up the body and left the fragments in one

lace, there would have been simply a ‘ collectio’3 but she
dropped them at intervaIS, so that there was a series of
⁴ collectiones:

Illum, τῖε. AEetes, the father of Medea. Hos, the soldiers of
Lucullus.

g 23.-—Excepit. Tigranes did not immediately espouse the quarrel of
his father-in-law. '

Cujus in requiem. Lucullus marched upon Tigranocerta, the
capital of the Armenian king, in 69 13.c.

Plures etiam, yenteS, ‘ more nations still? Never translate plures
⁴·several.’ These would be some of the dependent states on
the Caspian and the Persian Gulf. '

Gravis atque vehemens opinio, ⁴ a deep and fanatical conviction.’
It is quite impossible to say what temple Cicero alludes to,

Timaui, used for the genitive of Tiqraizcs.

ξ 25.-·—Reynum suum, τῖε. Pontus.

Sient poetoe. The poets alluded to are supposed to be Naevius,
who wrote a history of the First Punic War in Saturnian metre;
and Ennius, who wrote a history of Rome down to his own

, time in hexameters.
calamitatem> The speaker alludes to the disastrous defeat
