INTR ODUCTION. 3

mitted by Appius Claudius defeated the very object of
his mission to the Court of Tigranes. He was sent to
demand the surrender of Mithridates 3 he succeeded in
making the two kings firm friends3 but the only
immediate result of their alliance was, that Tigranes,
acting on his own responsibility, was severely defeated

unable to follow up his success, and withdrew to Ta-
laurus. On the other hand, Lucullus stood idle through
the mutiny of his men. Thus neither side was able to
act decisively, but the advantage of indecision lay
