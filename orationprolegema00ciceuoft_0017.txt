INTRODUCTION. 5

second place, it is sufficient to observe that the Manilian
law imputed to Lucullus the incompetence of Glabrio,
the very man who had been saddled 011 him by 1115
0116111165. On the whole, the fair conclusion is that a
triumph in political intrigue rather than a vindication
of paramount right was the object of the Lex Manilia.

We now come to the second question: what motives
were most likely to have operated in connecting Cicero
with such a measure as we have described? We must
bear 111 mind that Cicero was now close upon his
forticth year, so that hc would scel that the time had
now come, when he must make a bold effort to gain a
footing in that- political world, which had hitherto been
closed to him. His career thus far had been simply
that of a very successful advocate. He had been
elected 10 the offices of quaestor, aedile, and praetor, all
of which he had discharged or was discharging with
credit, yet without enhancing the reputation he had
gained by his brilliant victory over Verres and
Hortensius. But these successes in the forum did not
necessarily lead to eminence in the rostra, anymore
than pre-eminence in Lincoln’s Inn leads to the leader-
ship of the House of Commons. This was especially
the case with Cicero, who was a ‘novus homo. His
path to forensic success had been smooth and easy, but
between him and the consulship there was a wide gap,
and one which sheer merit could never bridge. He
could only wring promotion from fear or gratitude3
but to choose his friends and enemies was always
distressing to Cicero’s timicl nature. He might have
risen by the favour of the Plebs, but his heart was with
the Patricians. Besides, whatever may have been the
meanness of Cicero's character, he was no demagogue3
but the Patricians whom he would have served despised
him and his aid.
