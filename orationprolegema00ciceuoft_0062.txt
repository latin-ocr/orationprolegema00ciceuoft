50 NOTES.

sustained 'by Triarius near Zela in 67 13.c. 'she Romans lost
their camp and 7,000 men. ⁴ calamitas’ is a euphemistic
word for a defeat; cnf. the Greek use of ἆτυχία; τῆς ἀτυχίας
τῆς ἐν Χαιρωνείᾳ. AEsch. in Ctes. 55.

Non ea: proelz'o mmtius. The meaning seems to be that not a
man escaped to tell the tale. This is, however, an exaggera-
tion: Triarius escaped, and was secreted by Lueu1¹us from the
fury of the soldiery.

ἓ mie—Hic in ipso· - offensione: ‘ Hereon, immediately upon that. disaster,
and a most damaging miscarriage of our arms! ‘Ipso' here
has the force of disconnecting the ‘malo’ with every sub-
sequent eircumstance3 the force is ‘ the defeat just as it stood,
before anything could alter it.' Cnf. ‘in tempore ipse,’ ‘in
the very nick of time ;’ αὐτὸς has a similar force in Greek.

Tamen .· ⁶ after all.¹ The introduction of ‘tamen ’ gives a
parenthetical force to the clause, as if it were rather a passing
thought in Cicero's own mind than an observation addressed to
his hearers. Cnf. Virg. Ec. ix. 62, ‘ tamen veniemus in urbem!

Imperii diuturnitati. Lucullus had had the conduct of the war
against Mithridates conferred upon him as an extraordinary
command 13 c.74.1t was in consequence of a repert made to
the Senate by the delegates sent out to settle the affairs of
Pontus that a decree was pas <sed conferring the command on
Glabrio.

Stipendiis confectis.- ‘Their periods of service having been
completed.’ There was some fairness in this demandg of the
soldiers for their discharge, as some of the troops from
Fimbria had seen more than twenty years' foreign service.

of dauntlcss and stainless soldicrsl’ Pompey was like
Bajard, sa] es pour et sans repr-eche. Noticethat the imperfect

‘haberetis’ is used, because the wish' is impossible. In Greek
the impf. ancl aer. indicative with words of wishing have this
force, as εἴθ’ ὤφελ’ Ἀργοῦς μὴ διαπτάσθαι σκάφος, Med. Ῑ.
‘ Utinam habeatis' would mean ‘1 hope you may own.'
‘Putaretz's‘ is also imperfect because it all forms part of
circumstances which can never be realised. ‘ Quoe res—possit L? ’
‘What circumstance is there which can unsettle the convictiou
of any man in this case?²
