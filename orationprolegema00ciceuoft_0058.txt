46 NOTES.

Istbere loqui. Cicero means to insinuate that the provincials
were cowed by Lucullus or Glabrio.

Ceteros ejusmodi mittimus. Lit. ⁴ we send the others out such‚’
i.e.‚ the others whom we send out are such. Ejusmdi be-

, longs to the predicate, as if the bad character of these men
were due to the Romans who sent them out.

Hostili expuynatz'one. Cicero, in 565, repeats the mention of
the terror inspired in the wretched provincials by their
rapacious defenders. But it was most unsair to implicate
Lucullus in these exactions, as it was his unusual 0101110110)γ
and humanity which created his unpopularity with his troops.
Lucullus had fixed one per cent. sor the limit of taxation, and
annulled all ari-ears of interest, thereby making the capitalists
his bitter enemies. Inde-ed, Manilius was their mouthpiece
on this very occasion.

commoratur. The use of the indicative instead of the subjunctive
shows that the videantur expresses Cicero's opinion, not that
of the provincials.

ᾖ 14.—Antiocho. Antiochus ΙΙΙ. of Syria. This war began 192 131⁸.
The AEtolians were allies of Antiochus. The war arose out
of interference by the AEtolians with the Achaeans and other
members of the Roman alliance.

Philippo. Philippus V. of Macedonia. The date of this war is
200 Rc. The Romans had an old grudge against him, but
they mado a grievancc ofthe Atheni-ans their actual casus
belli.

Poeni. The First Punic XVar was the necessary result of the
rivalry with Rome for the possession of Sicily. They camo
into collision about Messana, The second Punic war began
by Hannibal attacking Saguntum. The Third Punic War
was fought 011 behalf of Massinissa, au any of Romo.

T ania sunt. ‘ Are just so great that wo can hardly recoup our-
selvcs for garrisoning them,' = ‘ are so small 111813 &c. Tantus
in itself means neither so great nor so sumu, but, of a particular
size.

L'bertatc ayrorum, gie. Cicero here indicates'three of the most
important sources of rcvenuc that the Romans had. The
‘ richncss of the cultivated lands’ supplied the ⁶ decumaess or
tithcs of wheat, barley. pulsc,-oil, wine, ἀι, which were
sarmed by the ‘ dccumani’ ; tho extent of pastumge supplied
the ⁸ scriptura ’ or ‘quit-rent,’ which the stockstxrmers, ⁶ pe-
cuarii‚’ paid. The large export trade supplied 1110 ·’ portoriun1,'
or duty 011 (Ἥρω-15, which passed through the hands of 1110
‘portit01·cs,' 01· custom-house officere. We have the same
three sources of τοι-011110 alluded to in g 15, ca· portu, ca· dc-
cumis, ca: scriptura.

Scriptura. Tho scriptura was the rent paid by those who
pastured cattle on tho state lands.¹ Tho name evidently im-
plies a custom of registering the number of head so pastui-ed,
and rccalls our own term of ‘copyholdff the essence of which
was. that tenunts held their lands on certain terms entered
