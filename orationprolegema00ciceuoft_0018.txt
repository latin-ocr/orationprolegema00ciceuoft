6 INTRODUCTION.

Fortunately for Cicero, the Manilian debate offered
a unique opportunity for judicious trimming. The
rising fortunes of Pompey gave him the very oppor-
tunity of striking into the politica] arena 118 needed.
In espousing Pompey's cause he must indeed throw

humanity must have seemed a bold flight. Cicero, how-
ever, was evidently determined that mere considerat-imis
