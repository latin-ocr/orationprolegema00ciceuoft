NOTES. 57

ξ 46.—Leqatum. The persons who are represented as Pompey’s
detractors are no doubt Metellus and his friends. We know
nothing further of the circumstances than what we gather
here. Mithridates sent commissionem to Sertorius on thc
other side; but he may have given instructions to sound
Pompey.

§47.—Rcliqzcum est—dieamus. ‘ Conccrning success—which no man
can ensure for himself, which we can recall and commemorato

enemies bowcd to it, but even the winds and the seasons have

Erat diligendus. ‘He was the man to be chosen‚’ is more

In‘5'59‚ Cicero mentions the striking proof of confidence
which the populace showed him when he was opposing their
darling Gabini‘in Bill.

Q. Hortensius Cicero’s great opponent in the Vei-iine' case.
Hortensius showcd a c›rdial spirit towards Cicero, but tho
