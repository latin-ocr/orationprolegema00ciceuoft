CICERO’S ORATION

(γ) ἓξ 18-39. But, besides the Publicani, there are numbers of en·

terpnsing men, who have gone out to Asia, in the security 01
Roman citizenship, to carry out private enterprises, and to found
a trade abroad. Their relations with Roman traders are such
that, if their credit is impaired, a panio must ensue at home.

B. ἓξ 20-26. T he Limits of the War.

ἐξ 20-21. The waris important enough to be troublesome, though

not alarming. We have to thank Lucullus for many important
services against Mithridates, which 1 here cordially acknowledge.

ἐξ 22-·26. But Lucullus has not made good tho successes he has

gained. Mithridates has saved the nucleus of a powerful
establishment, and has formed an allianee with Tigranes. At
the same time many nations are up in arms against us, whose
hostility it, was no part of our policy to provoke. Lastly, there
is that stinging and disastrous defeat which Triarius, the
lieutenant of Lucullus, has sustained. The general result is,
that Lucullus is discredsted, and, with a ‹liscontented army, is
unable to make head against the new and powerful enemies that
are everywhere closing in upon him.

C. The Conduct os the War.—Pompey is the only competent general.

(α) ἐξ 27-50. States their ease. (fl) §S 51-68. Answers the case of
their opponents.

(α) Pompey's claim rests upon his unrivalled pre-eminence in the

four qualities which a commander should have: (1)‘ his military
genius; (2) his soldierly virtues ; (3) his prestige; (4) his
good genius.

g 28. As to tho first point, the bare enumeration of his exploits is

sufficient. There can be no emergency where he will be at
au t.

ἓξ 29-35. As to the second point, the perfect soldier must be

indefatigable, prompt, and pertinaciouS. Now there never was
a soldier who displayed these qualities as Pompey has done.
We have scen him put to the proof in Italy, Sicily, Africa,
Gaul, and Spain 3 but, above all, the whole world is still ringing
with his unmatched campaign against the Cilician pimtes3
against those pirates who were the terror, not only of the seas,
but of our own coasts. Yet, in forty-eight days from setting
sai]‚ Pompey had reduced these audaeious pirates to perfect
submission.

§g 36-42. Nor is Pompey less libel-ally endowed with the other

qualities which go to make a great soldier. 110 is the soul of
honour, and superior to any temptation. He never abuses his
power to enrich himself ; so much so, that he has taken away
the reproach which a long line of rapacious officers had brought
on Rome. Steeled against pleasure, mxu-icc, and every charin
of foreign trax-el, he makes his duty his one nim, and is direx-ted
neither to the right nor to the left. 110 is equally ha py in his
dealings with foreigners before and after conquest. fiis readi-
