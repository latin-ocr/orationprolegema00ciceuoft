in the first Mithridatio war, in the beginning of 81 1³.c. Two
days were devoted to the spectaele, which comprised vast
treasures and hordes of captives -in fact every symbol of

Sertorius to propose joint aetion. Sertorius sent M. Roman
Officers to train his troops, while the ⁷ king sent Sertorius men
,and ships. We cannot wonder that M. made these prepara-
tions, as the Roman Senate, by refusing to ratify the treaty
madlzlz by Sulla with M.‚ showed clearly their intention of
crus ing him.

Binis. Bim' is not here used for duo, but has its full force of
two each. There were two enemies, and each enemy had a
land force and a sea force.

Ancipiti—dimicanti& ‘ till challenged on two flanks you were
virtually defending your sovereiguty.‘ Anceps means any·
thing which may be looked at in two ways, ‘puzzling ’; thus
⁴ ancipiti obsequio' (Pers v. 156) means the divided service
of one man to two masters, between whom he is always run·
ning baekwards and sorwards. The meaning ‘doubtfuL’
‘dangerous,’ is only seeondnry, and young students should
beu-are of mistaking it for the primary meaning.
