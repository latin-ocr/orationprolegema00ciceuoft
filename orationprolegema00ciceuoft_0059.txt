oldest taxes in Rome.

Earum rerum quoe exportentur. ‘ Of things which can be ex-
ported,' whether there is a demand for them at a particular
time or not. The other reading, exportantur, means ⁴ the
actual experts.⁷

to think it is the present: (1) because we should rather hav e

which are contrasted are calamitas aud metus, and to introduce
another antithesis in the tenses would be to weaken the force
of the principal antithesis.

Saltibus. The reading of the MSS. is salinis, the salt-mines,
But as Cicero has not mentioned them in the present cou-
nection, a reading has been adopted to correspond to the
scriptura. The saltus are the‘ downs’ 011 which the sheep fed.

Publiecmi.1f there is one word which might possibly indicate*
the whole field which the operations of the publicani covered,
it is ‘foreign finanee,’ so that they might be called* financiers!
They took off the hands of the state the task of collecting the
whole revenue of conquercd countries, buying the right of
representing the state at a price fixed by auetiou, and of
course running the risk of 3 profit or loss. Cicero herc
indicates the three principa] sources of 16161136, because the
revenue from the salt· -mines and mineral mines was probably
inconsiderable in this particular case. The chief points to
notice about the publicani are (1), that they bought the con-
