NOTES. 45

Marinus and Spanish mountaineers whom· Sertorius led, and
the untrained and undrilled Asiatic lew'es that Mithridates
had to command. Sertorius twice defeated Pompey himself.
Mithridates knew that his only chance of coping with the
Romans was to train and drill his own troops, but they could
never be brought under discipline,

§IL-Mercatoribus injuriosius tractatis. The piratical wars would
come under this category; sor instance, the war with the
Illyrian pirates under their masculine Queen Teuta (nc.
230). But, no doubt, many aggressive wars, which Rome
made for conquest, would be put down to some flimsy affront
offered to Roman traderS.

Appellati superbius. According to another account, Diaeus·
actually threw the commissioners sent by Metellus into prison.
Cicero perhaps chooses the milder version, according to which
Orestes and his colleagues were only ‘ insultingly addressed,'
to heighten the enormity of Mithridates’ conduct. The cele-
brated sack of Corinth by Mummius took place B.c. 146.

Leyatzcm populi Romani consularem. Cicero here alludes to
events which> took place at the first outbreak of the Mith-
ridatio war. Mithridates had defeated M. Aquilius, who
fied to Pergamum. There he fell into the hands of the
king, who put him to a cruel death.

chs—perseeuti sunt. ‘ They upheld the principle of audience
when merely prejudiced by language.‘ chs is a difficult word
to translate, because it includes both the general rights and
particular rules of a subject. >

Relinquetis, ⁴ abandons ‘ leave unrevenged.’

ἓ 12.-Ar2‘0bar2anes was the nominee of the Romans for the crown of
Cappadocia, to which he was elected ΒΕ. 93. He was a warm
¹ partizan of Rome; so much so, that he was surnamed φιλο-
ρώμαιος. Mithridates expelled him from the throne several
times: once in Re. 92, again in nc. 90, aud a third time in

B.c. 66, after the delivery of this oration.

Cuncta Asia. The word canctus is from conjunctus, so that it
means ⁴ all’ collectively‚ as in Div. 1, ‘qui nunc canen·
ad me venerunt': omnis, on the other hand, means ⁸ all’ dis-
tributively, ‘ each and every’: totas applies to what is whole
and homogeneous. It is better therefore to take cuncta
Asia atque Groeeia as in the nominatixe, in apposition with
omnes civitates, than as in the ablatixe.

Imperatore n cerluir, ‘a determinate commander! Certus here
clearly shows its nature as the participle of cerno, to ‘ pick.’
Quum praesertim. ‘Praesertim’ is often used to emphasize
relatives and relative adverbs, qui, quum, &c. It generally

follows the word which it emphasizes.
