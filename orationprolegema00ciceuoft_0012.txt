vi PREFACE.

I make no apology, therefore, for having freely im-
ported into my notes much matter which the student
is often, with cruel irony, told to find in the various
dictionaries. Resides, a boy has not often access to
the longer works, while the abridgments are often

deficient in the little details which most need explana-
tion. â€™
