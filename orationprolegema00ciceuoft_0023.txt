PRO

LEGE MANIHA ORATIO.

——000—

ANALYSIS.

§g 1—5. Cicero conciliatos the fiwour of his hearers by reminding
them that this is the first occasion on which he has addressed them
from the Rostra. He now dedicates to them the practice and address
which he has acquired by diligent attention to the intcrcsts of his
clients in the law—courts. He congratulates himself on the splendid
theme that he has for his maiden speech.

He then introduces the subject which they are met to consider,
namely, the war with Mithridates ; and divides the consideration of the
subject under three heads: (A) The category to which the war belongs3
(B) the limits of the wan (C) the conduct of the war.

A. ἐξ 1-19. The Cateyory to which the War helenae—(a) It is a
war for prestige, §g 6-14. (β) It is a war for the finaneial stability

οἷ’ [1ιέ cignpirg, ἓξ 14-17. (Ὺ) It is a war for the protectioni of Romans
{in-oa , ᾗ 1 - 9.

(α) ἐξ 7-10. It is a standing reproach to Rome that Mithridates
should so long def)- hor power. He has massacrcd her subject-53
he has falsified the triumphs which Sulla and Murena celebrated
over him. He has intrigucd with the enemies of Rome even in
Spain.

ἐξ 11-14. It is intolerable that Romans should be so de-
generata from their ancestors, who sacked Corinth for an in-
sult to a delegate, that they grant impunity to the actual mur-
derer of a consular delegate. What agam can be more insulting
than his conduct towards Ariobarzanes? Cannot Rome maintain
her nominee to a crown in his crown?

(Β) ἐξ 14-17. He has disorganised the whole system of Roman
finanoe, and paralysed the enterprise of the-Publicani. He
has interrupted agriculture, commcrce, and grazfflg, so that he
Strikes at the three chief sources of Roman reve-nuc. The in-
tel-ests directly assailed are those of the Publimni, it is truc;
but on their solidity the financo of the empirc rests.
