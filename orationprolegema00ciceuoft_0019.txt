INTRO DUCTION. ’7

of fact should not impede him. The oration was, so to
say, the diploma speech of a candidate who was staking
a great reputation earned in one path on an entirely
new venture. We can believe that in Rome, as in
England, great lawyers were seldom great statesmen.
Hortensius had not maintained in the senate the reputa-
tion which he brought from the bar, and the mere
ambition of vanquishing an old rival in a new field must
have braced Cicero to the strongest effort‚ Many things
were in his favorun In this speech, for one of the very
few occasions in his life, he spoke with the full tide of
popular enthusiasm. At the same time, he is anxious
to make the exclusive Patricians know that 110 must
be conciliated. N aturally, therefore, he speaks with
passion and fire. That he was betrayed into exaggera-
tion in the praises he heaped on Pompey he was himself
conscious (Or. 29), butl he carries off the exaggeration
by the wonderful grace of his language. In fine, while
we cannot but suspect the genuineness of some of the
orator's motioes, no one can dispute the genuineness of
his eloquenee. And, perhaps, even the most virtuous
critics need not feel aggrieved that Cicero st-ill survives
their maste‘rly exposure of his moral nothingness. The
critias are always right, if eheerfully forgotten3 while
Cicero’s tarnished name still flashes with the splendour
of immortal genius.
